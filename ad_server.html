          <p>
            Participants recruited via Mechanical Turk first interact with your task via <b>ads</b>.
            Ads are simply the digital version of hanging a poster or flyer around your university
            building in order to recruit participants.
            Technically, <b>ads</b> are snippets of HTML code that describe what your task is about
            and what you're offering for compensation.
            As a result, they are the front line for any
            subject recruitment online.  It's easy to overlook the importance of a good ad, and making
            that ad visible to as many participants as possible.
          </p>

          <p>
            The <b>psiTurk</b> Ad Server is a cloud-based solution for delivering ads to
            participants securely, while providing experimenters useful information about
            who is taking their experiment, where they are connecting from, and possibly
            what other experiments they have completed.
