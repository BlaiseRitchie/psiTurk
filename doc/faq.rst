Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

My university will not give me a static IP address.  Can I still use **psiTurk**?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**psiTurk** requires an generally internet-addressable computer.  Some
universities prevent this for security purposes.  There are a couple of solutions
if this situation applies to you.  First you can run psiturk via an
`ssh` session on any remote computer or server for which you can launch
server processes.  Examples would be a lab server that has a static ip
address and allows users-lavel access to particular ports.  Alternative
there are a number of (free) services which will give you a unix
command line "in the cloud" including Red Hat's `OpenShift <https://www.openshift.com/>`__.


I'm trying to run **psiTurk** at home using a cable modem or other connection.  Will it work?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In general this set up is definitely possible.  However, you may need to configure
the wireless router that came with your internet service to forward particular incoming
ports to your device (i.e., to you laptop instead of you phone or tablet).  There are
many excellent tutorials about this `online <http://www.howtogeek.com/66214/how-to-forward-ports-on-your-router/>`__.


Can you program my experiment for me?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Nope, sorry.  Please check the `experiment exchange <https://psiturk.org/ee>`__ for 
examples you might be able to draw insight from.

I'm having Javascript error when designing my experiment.  Can you help?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sorry, but probably not.  See the above about programming experiments.  There are many 
ways of `getting help <getting_help.rst>`__ with **psiTurk** specifically and many
excellent tutorials online for developing web applications using Javascript.  A good
example is `CodeAcademy's Javascript lessons <http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript>`__.
