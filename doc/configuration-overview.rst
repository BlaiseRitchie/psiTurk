Configuration Overview
======================

While AWS credentials are :ref:`handled separately <amt-credentials>`, psiTurk
reads configuration settings from the following three places, and in the
following order, with former entries being preferred over later ones.

1. Environment variables, optionally specified in a ``.env`` file.
2. A ``config.txt`` file
3. A ``.psiturkconfig`` file
3. Defaults

That is to say, (3) there exist defaults for many settings, (2) but a user
may specify preferred defaults in a ``config.txt`` file, which may be overridden
by (2) a ``.psiturkconfig`` file, with (1) environment variables superseding
any previous setting.

psiTurk loads and uses the ``python-dotenv`` library, which means that, on
platforms that respect it, you can store KEY=VALUE pairs in a file called ``.env``
in your project's home directory, and they will be read in as environment variables
by psiTurk.

While any setting can be set via environment variables, only some make sense to
do so. For instance, configuration settings that are credentials-related should
not be saved to source code repositories, from whence they may leak. Instead,
they can be set via environment variables. Such include the following:

* :ref:`settings-database-url`, when it contains embedded credentials
* :ref:`dashboard <dashboard-overview>` login and username

In other instances, a different setting may be desired for "development" environments
than in "production" ones. For example, local development may want to use one
database, while a psiturk experiment deployed onto a cloud hosting service for
"live" data collection may want to use a different database. Or, different server
host, port, and threads settings may be desired. Other settings can enable or disable
dashboard and task-runner features, which may only be desirable for certain deployments.
Environment variables are ideal for situations like these.

However, most other settings are best stored where they can be shared with others,
for science replication purposes. Such settings should go in ``config.txt``.

Additionally, a user may set any available setting to a global preferred
value in a file called ``.psiturkconfig``.

Finally, many -- but not all -- settings have psiturk-set defaults. Look in an
example config.txt file generated by the ``psiturk-setup-example``, and on
:ref:`the settings page within these docs <settings>`, for extensive documentation
on the different settings and their defaults.

.. note::

   In general, changes made to configuration settings
   require restarting the server process as it may change
   the behavior. Generally it is best to edit these files while
   psiturk is not running, and then restart the server.


Local configuration file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A sample default local configuration file can be viewed on github
`here <https://github.com/NYUCCL/psiTurk/tree/master/psiturk/example/config.txt.sample>`__.
A copy of this file is placed in the example directory as part of running the
``psiturk-setup-example`` command. In order for changes to ``config.txt`` to be
read by psiturk, this file must be placed in the root of the psiturk study directory.

See :ref:`settings` for descriptions of the available configuration parameters.


.psiturkconfig global config file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Any configuration option can actually be placed in either the global or local
configuration file. For example, if you wanted to run different project from
different AWS accounts, you could add an ``[AWS access]`` section to move the
local config.txt files and have different values in different folders. And
vice-versa -- any setting could be placed in the ``.psiturkconfig`` file in lieu
of in config.txt.

By default, ``.psiturkconfig`` is searched for in the user's home directory
( ``~/.psiturkconfig``), but the search location can be customized by setting
the ``PSITURK_GLOBAL_CONFIG_LOCATION`` environment variable (cannot be set
via the ``.env`` file -- must be available in the shell environment).

.. important::

    Keep in mind that settings in the local `config.txt` file always override
    settings in the global `.psiturkconfig` file.
