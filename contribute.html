          <p>
            <b>psiTurk</b> is a community-run project for the benefit of scientific research.  There are many
            ways to contribute.
          </p>
          <br>

          <div class="main-subsection-name">1. Use it!</div>
          <p>
           <b>psiTurk</b> will get better by having users.  More users mean more interoperable,
           shareable code, which means more replicability in science.  Like everything new there is
           a bit to learn, but we have tried to put together <a href="/docs">helpful guides</a>.  It
           is in heavy use in our lab and others!
          </p>

          <br>
          <div class="main-subsection-name">2. Share your experiment code</div>
          <p>
           If you use <b>psiTurk</b> to develop and deploy your experiment, why not contribute it to the
           <a href="/ee">experiment exchange</a>?  This will allow other people to easily replicate your
           design with (basically) the same population and procedures.  Sharing your code is a very
           powerful statement that you support open science and the direct replication of behavioral studies.
           In addition, many students and researchers may benefit from being able to build new
           experiments based on your code.
          </p>

          <br>
          <div class="main-subsection-name">3. Report bugs</div>
          <br>
          <p>
           If you find bugs or weird things why not report them?  This will help everyone in the community.
           On the project's <a href="https://github.com/NYUCCL/psiTurk/issues?state=open">github</a> page there
           is an <a href="https://github.com/NYUCCL/psiTurk/issues?state=open">Issue Tracker</a> which allows anyone
           to post a bug report.  Ideally this should be a genuine bug.  General questions about how to use <b>psiTurk</b>
           can be directed to our <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/psiturk">Google group</a>.
          </p>

          <br>
          <p>
            Remember, <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/psiturk">Google group</a> for general questions about using <b>psiTurk</b>, <a href="https://github.com/NYUCCL/psiTurk/issues?state=open">Github Issues</a> for genuine bug reports and
            feature requests.  Also good idea to check both places before posting your question to see if it has
            been answered already.
          </p>

          <div class="main-subsection-name">4. Help improve the documentation</div>
          <p>
           An important part of any open-source tool is good documentation.  We've tried to get things
           started with a nice set of <a href="/docs">videos and guides</a>.  However, if you have a better
           way to describe things, or came up against an issue you think would be helpful for other
           users to know about, please consider contributing to our documentation website.  This is fully
           under version control via Github and anyone can lend a hand.  A guide for contributors is
           available <a href="http://psiturk.readthedocs.org/en/latest/contribute.html">here</a>.
          </p>

          <br>
          <div class="main-subsection-name">5. Lend your web-programming skills</div>
          <p>
           In addition to contributing experiment code, we have a fully open development model.  If you have ideas
           for how to improve <b>psiTurk</b>, please feel free to discuss the idea with the project
           maintainers (by creating an feature request Issue on github) and then create a pull-request on Github!
           A full guide to how to contribute is provided <a href="https://github.com/NYUCCL/psiTurk/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">here</a> and <a href="http://psiturk.readthedocs.org/en/latest/contribute.html">here</a> (HTML).

          <h3 class="main-subsection-name">Why contribute?  The three sentence sales pitch.</h3>
          <p>Think of all the wasted effort across academic labs and those in industry when programmers
            re-implement the same experiment design over and over.  By sharing your experiment code you
            help others replicate and extend your findings while also providing a great resource for
            education.  Students and researchers can learn from your code and use the best ideas in their
            own science projects.
